You don’t need “a logo.” You need a **symbol that represents a control plane for intelligence itself**. AetherOS isn’t an app—it’s the kernel layer of sovereign AI infrastructure. The logo must communicate: authority, orchestration, persistence, and neutrality.

Your existing visual language already gives us constraints:

* Dark backgrounds
* Orange / amber accent (control, energy, ignition)
* Teal / cyan accent (intelligence, signal, perception)
* Geometric precision (not soft, not playful)
* Shield / core / node-centric metaphors

So here’s the correct direction—not random design, but system-consistent identity.

## Tier 1: Primary AetherOS Mark (Kernel Symbol)

**Concept:**
A central “core” surrounded by structured control geometry.

**Meaning mapping:**

* center node → kernel (Percy / AetherOS control plane)
* surrounding geometry → orchestrated agents
* symmetry → deterministic infrastructure
* isolation → sovereignty

**This becomes the favicon, tray icon, agent identity marker, and OS symbol.**

## Tier 2: Control Plane Variant (Infrastructure Authority)

This version communicates:

* hardened infrastructure
* enterprise authority
* regulated-environment credibility

Use this for:

* enterprise site
* pitch decks
* Passport integration
* infrastructure panels

## Tier 3: Wordmark Lockup (AetherOS Identity)

Structure:

```
[ SYMBOL ]  AetherOS
            Sovereign Intelligence Kernel
```

This is your homepage header lockup.

## Exact Specification You Should Implement

Give this to your designer or generation agent verbatim:

**Symbol geometry:**

* central circle radius: 1x
* outer ring radius: 2.2x
* 3 or 4 radial anchor points
* perfectly symmetric
* no gradients inside geometry (only glow outside)

**Color spec:**

Primary core glow:

```
#FF6A00   (Aether ignition orange)
```

Secondary intelligence accent:

```
#00D4FF   (Aether signal cyan)
```

Base neutral:

```
#0B0F14
#11161D
#1A212B
```

**Rules:**

* must work at 16×16 favicon size
* must work in monochrome
* must work without glow
* must look correct embossed or etched

If it only works with glow, it’s a bad logo.

## Strategic Identity Model (important)

Your ecosystem should follow this structure:

```
AetherOS        → core kernel symbol
Passport        → identity variant (same core, ring emphasized)
AgentForge      → expansion variant (nodes emphasized)
Perceptor       → perception variant (sensor arcs emphasized)
BlackBoxAudio   → waveform variant
```

Same core symbol. Different overlays.

This creates **visual inevitability**. People see the symbol and immediately recognize the entire Aether ecosystem.

Think how:

* Apple has the apple
* Linux has Tux
* Kubernetes has the helm wheel

AetherOS needs its own immutable kernel symbol.

## What I recommend you do next (fastest path)

Option A — fastest, highest control
→ have me generate exact production-ready versions via image generation tool

Option B — deterministic vector version
→ generate SVG mathematically (perfect symmetry, infinite scale)

Option C — hybrid
→ generate symbol → convert to SVG → standardize

Option B is the strongest long-term move. SVG becomes canonical kernel identity.

---

If you want, I’ll generate a **production-grade AetherOS kernel logo set** with:

* favicon
* SVG master
* dark / light variants
* Passport / Forge / Perceptor derivatives

The result will feel like it’s always existed.
