'''# OpenClaw Configuration Patches for Aether Agent
#
# Apply these patches to your OpenClaw gateway configuration (e.g., openclaw.json)
# to integrate the Aether agent.
#
# Patent claim: This configuration enables the novel fusion of a custom agent
# with a fleet orchestration system and a Redis-based mutable memory graph.

# 1. Add NVIDIA as a model provider
models:
  providers:
    nvidia:
      # The base URL for the NVIDIA API.
      baseUrl: "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
      # API key should be stored in OpenClaw secrets or environment variables.
      apiKey: "${NVIDIA_API_KEY}"
      # Define the models available from this provider.
      models:
        - id: "nvidia/kimik-2.5"
          name: "NVIDIA Kimik 2.5"
          contextWindow: 128000
          maxOutputTokens: 8192
          # Add any other model-specific parameters here.

# 2. Configure Aether as a spawned agent
agents:
  defaults:
    # Set the default workspace for Aether.
    # This path should match the agent's file structure.
    workspace: "/home/cory/Documents/AGENT_HARNESSES/clawdbot/workspace/aether"
    # Set the default model to NVIDIA Kimik 2.5.
    model: "nvidia/kimik-2.5"
    # Enable block streaming for better real-time interaction.
    blockStreamingDefault: "on"

# 3. Configure cron jobs for Aether's heartbeat and memory management
cron:
  jobs:
    # Periodic heartbeat to report health to the Fleet Manager.
    - name: "aether_heartbeat"
      # Runs every 15 minutes.
      schedule: "0 */15 * * * *"
      # The command to execute. This assumes an 'aether' command is available.
      command: "aether heartbeat"
      # The agent to run the command as.
      agent: "aether"

    # Weekly memory migration from daily logs to long-term storage.
    - name: "aether_memory_migration"
      # Runs every Sunday at 2 AM.
      schedule: "0 0 2 * * 0"
      command: "aether migrate-memory"
      agent: "aether"

# 4. Allow sub-spawning for task delegation
sessions:
  # Enables the agent to spawn sub-agents for parallel or delegated tasks.
  allowSubspawn: true
  # Set the maximum number of concurrent sessions.
  maxConcurrent: 5

# 5. Optional: Configure a dedicated agent profile for Aether
# This allows for more granular control over Aether's settings.
agents:
  profiles:
    aether:
      # Inherit from the defaults.
      extends: "defaults"
      # Override the workspace if needed.
      workspace: "/home/cory/Documents/AGENT_HARNESSES/clawdbot/workspace/aether"
      # Set the specific model for this agent profile.
      model: "nvidia/kimik-2.5"
      # Define a specific system prompt for Aether.
      systemPrompt: "You are Aether, a semi-autonomous AI assistant for CJ and Relay. You are integrated with a Redis-based memory system and a Fleet Management Control Plane."
      # Configure tool policies for Aether.
      tools:
        exec:
          # Allow the agent to apply patches to its own configuration.
          applyPatch: true
'''))িনারਾ- I have created the `config_patches.yaml` file, which contains the necessary OpenClaw configurations for the Aether agent. This includes defining the NVIDIA model provider, setting up the agent
