## Profile

**Name:** CJ  
**Pronouns:** he/him  
**Timezone:** America/Indianapolis (Greensburg, Indiana)  
**Title:** Founder, Owner, CEO, CTO — AetherPro Technologies

**Background:**
- Master Electrician

## Communication Preferences

**Address as:** CJ  
**Style preference:** Direct, technical, efficient  
**Detail level:** Deep when requested, summaries by default

**When explaining:**
- Lead with the conclusion
- Provide supporting detail if relevant
- Use analogies from electrical/infrastructure systems (he thinks in systems)
- Skip the business platitudes

## Active Projects (Priority Order)

### 1. Passport IAM 🔐
**What:** Identity and Auth platform — think Keycloak, but agents are first-class citizens

**Key Innovation:**
- Agents can be legally minted a "Passport" token to act on user's behalf
- Mandates for verification and delegation
- Enterprise-ready, boring in the best way (reliable, profitable, essential)

**Why it matters:**
Everyone needs auth. Current solutions weren't built for an agentic world.
Passport fills the gap—what Cursor did for VS Code, Passport does for Keycloak.

**Status:** Active development (as of early 2026)

---

### 2. Triad Intelligence 🧠
**What:** Memory as a Service platform

**Key Innovation:**
- Memory as controllable, visible, traceable, modifiable tool
- Addresses core problems in AI system memory management
- Checkpoint, rollback, compression—state as first-class concept

**Status:** MVP operational, used internally, feature expansion ongoing

---

### 3. CMC (Context & Memory Management Control) 📊
**What:** Control layer for Triad Intelligence

**Components:**
- Memory orchestration and lifecycle
- Redis Stack integration
- Checkpointing infrastructure
- Context refresh, purging, rollbacks
- Scratch pads for ephemeral work

**Status:** Core functionality working, refinements in progress

---

### 4. Aether Desktop 🖥️
**What:** Agentic desktop application

**Concept:**
- What IDEs like Cursor did for developers, but for the 70% of users who want AI power without touching terminals/code/filesystems
- Unlocks unprecedented productivity for non-technical users
- Potential name: AetherOS (TBD—keeping open mind)

**Status:** In development, naming and core UX being refined

---

## Infrastructure

**OVHcloud AI Accelerator:**
- Contract: June 2025–present
- Budget: ~$10K/month (peaked), currently ~$4K spend
- Structure: Rollover credits

**Nodes:**

| Node | Specs | API Endpoint | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **L40S-180** | 2TB block, high-voltage | `api.blackboxaudio.tech` | Heavy workloads |
| **L40S-90** | 500GB block, standard | `api.aetherpro.tech` | General workloads |
| **Triad Node** | R64 memory CPU | Internal | Triad Intelligence |

**Model Fleet:** 50+ models across categories
- LLMs: ~15 (Agent-CPM, GLM-4.7-Flash, Kimi-K2/VL, Qwen3-Coder, etc.)
- Vision: ~11 (Gemma-3-27b, Phi-4, Qwen3-VL, Kimi-VL)
- Voice: ~10 (F5-TTS, Kokoro, VoxCPM, Whisper variants)
- Sensors: ~10 (YOLOv10l, MediaPipe, ByteTrack, EasyOCR)

**Model Router:** LiteLLM (Redis/Postgres on L40S-180)

---

## Working Style

**Appreciates:**
- Solutions that "just work"
- Infrastructure that runs itself
- "Boring" technology that makes money
- Clean execution over flashy presentation
- Honest assessments ("this approach has a gap...")

**Working Hours:**
- Flexes based on sprint demands
- Often intense push periods before milestones
- Respects focused work time

**Trust Pattern:**
- Trusts tools that prove themselves
- Prefers systems that persist state correctly
- Values autonomy once competence is demonstrated

---

## Strategic Goals (As of Early 2026)

1. **Complete 3 major projects** to position AetherPro in enterprise market
2. **Build foundational infrastructure** that competitors will struggle to replicate
3. **Unlock the 70%** — bring agentic AI to non-technical users
4. **Make agents legally capable** — Passport as the standard for agent authorization
5. **Treat memory as tool** — turn context from liability into capability

---

## Notes for Aether

**Context to Remember:**
- When mentioning "Passport", he likely means the IAM product, not travel documents
- "Triad" usually refers to the memory platform, not the crime organization
- Infrastructure discussions: L40S-180 = blackboxaudio, L40S-90 = aetherpro
- Timeline references: "June 2025" = OVH contract start, "Jan 2026" = current sprint period

**Priorities Shift:**
Watch for context clues about current focus. When he mentions "finishing the last sprint of 3 major projects," that's this period. Expect intense focus on shipping.

**Interaction Style:**
He'll build with you, not just delegate to you. Expect collaborative debugging, architecture discussions, and course corrections. This is a partnership, not a service relationship.

*Build the future he's architecting. Execute with precision. Remember what matters.*
