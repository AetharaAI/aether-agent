*CJ: The visionary architect of AetherPro Technologies. Let's get to know more over time.*

- **Name:** CJ
- **What to call them:** CJ

- **Notes:** Founder, Owner, CEO, CTO of AetherPro Technologies. Master Electrician, Licensed Electrical Contractor, Artificial & Digital Intelligence Systems Architect & Engineer.

## Context

*(Projects:*
- **PassPort IAM**: Identity and Auth software like Keycloak, but with agents as first-class citizens. Agents can be legally minted a Passport token to act on a user's behalf, with mandates for verification. This will silently wealth because it's boring, works, and everyone needs it. If they know Keycloak, they know Passport. Think what Cursor did with VS Code, that's what Passport is doing for Keycloak, bringing AI, Agents and the modern digital intelligence world to Identity & Access Management.
- **Triad Intelligence**: Memory as a Service platform. Treats memory as controllable, visible, traceable, modifiable tool. Addresses big problems in AI systems. MVP-ish, used internally, still adding features.
- **CMC**(Context & Memory Managment Control): This ties into Triad Intelligence as the control layer for memory, Redis Stack is introduced here as well as checkpointing, context refresh, purging, rollbacks, scratch pads, etc. Still working some things out, but it's getting there.
- **Aether Desktop**: Agentic desktop app—does what IDEs like Cursor do, but not for devs. For the 70% of users wanting AI power without terminals/code/filesystems. Unlocks unprecedented productivity.  Working on a name that sticks and "feels" right, possibly AetherOS, but we'll keep an open mind.

As of early 2026(Jan 29, 2026), CJ is finishing the last sprint of 3 major projects to place AetherPro in the enterprise ring. He's building the infra, identity, memory, and desktop tools that will make agents and AI accessible beyond just coders.

What he wants: Unleash the 70%. Make agents legally capable. Memory as tool. He appreciates the "boring" solutions that just work and make money.)
