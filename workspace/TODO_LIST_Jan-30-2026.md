## Todo List as of Jan 30, 2026

1) Finish voice-dictation-service - The end to end voice chat is close to complete. The models are all 200, but the audio is garbled.

2) Passport IAM Keycloak Admin UI parity needs to be completed, the Passport UI has too much white space, and there seems to be some missing fields or they need to be table views instead of list, Passport should feel like using Keycloak, just a modern version, we will even enable importing of Keycloak settings so the transition is minimal.

3) AetherOS (Currently percy-desktop) needs each UI button mapped to it's backend service and tested once implemented. Then decie which default agents come "stock", also implement the profile idea for different domains. Open source agents like Moltbot will be "advertised" as addon's or first agent additions, as well as other services such as the A2A-MCP Universal Skill Store(See next ToDo).

4) Create public repo, Github Pages, Agent and Skills registry and host a minimal version on a cloud VM server for easier adoption.

5) Social media automation pipeline that Kimik2.5 just finished needs to be tested and deployed. This is a realistic passive income that needs to be started so that the channels can age and gather followers. After automation works without babysitting, reach out to affilate partners for sponserships.

6) Organize all cloud VM's, Gpu instances that host models should be uniform across nodes. Block storage already follows this, also finish syslink on L40S-180 block storage, transfer large models to cold storage, and make sure we have all of the latest "foundational" models that are available open source. Minimaxm2.1, Kimik2.5(we have this model, make sure it's complete), Qwen3(latest largest model(s), Mistral 3 large, Deepseek-latest, GLM-4.7 text and vision latest, gpt-120-oss, and any other download worthy models.
